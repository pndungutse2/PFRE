Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have Standard Overdraft Practices that come with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practices. You can contact us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practices. This •notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. What are the Standard Overdraft Practices that come with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number • Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we will authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card • transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Insufficient Funds Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an InsufficieSnMt Funds Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase • checking accounts. • We wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a • sufficient available bSaMlance in your account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Insufficient Funds Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this • counts toward the four business days when an Insufficient Funds Fee will not be charged. What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or collect at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have Standard Overdraft Practices that come with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practices. You can contact us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage, which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practices. This •notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. What are the Standard Overdraft Practices that come with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number • Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we will authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card • transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Insufficient Funds Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an InsufficieSnMt Funds Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase • checking accounts. • We wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Insufficient Funds Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a • sufficient available bSaMlance in your account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Insufficient Funds Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this • counts toward the four business days when an Insufficient Funds Fee will not be charged. What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or collect at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? We d- o authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: - Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee (may also be referred to as Insufficient Funds Fee) per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). We w- ont charge you an Overdraft Fe S e M in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible - Chase checking accounts. - We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a - sufficient available bSaMlance in your account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? We d- o authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: - Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee (may also be referred to as Insufficient Funds Fee) per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). We w- ont charge you an Overdraft Fe S e M in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible - Chase checking accounts. - We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a - sufficient available bSaMlance in your account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an OverdraSftM Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking • accounts. • We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient • available balance in SyMour account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Arbitration; Resolving Disputes to be published November 17, 2024: • What claims or disputes subject to arbitration?: Claims or disputed factual or legal issues that arise out of or relate in any way to any aspect of our relationship or interactions with each other, including but not limited to your deposit account, transactions involving your deposit account, whether actual, potential, canceled, or other transactions, any product, service, or agreement with us, or • interactions of any kind with Chase employees are subject to arbitration. Can I (customer) cancel or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate?: You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate if you tell us within sixty (60) days of opening your account, or by January 16, 2025, whichever is later. The exclusive way to opt out is by calling us at 1-800-935-9935. Any other method, form, or means of opting out will be treated as invalid or ineffective. Requests to opt out made • more than sixty (60) days after opening your account or by January 16, 2025, whichever is later, will be invalid. Does arbitration apply to Claims involving third parties?: For purposes of arbitration, you includes any person who is listed on your account or claims a right or interest in your account, and we and us includes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., all its affiliates, third-party beneficiaries of this agreement and all third parties who are regarded as agents or representatives of ours in connection with a • Claim. How does arbitration work?: Arbitration between us shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), which will apply its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced and the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules to mass arbitration matters. A single arbitrator shall conduct proceedings under the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and a Process Arbitrator and single Merits Arbitrator shall conduct each mass arbitration case. The Parties agree that, upon motion by either of us, the arbitrator or Merits Arbitrator shall have the power to decide dispositive issues of law prior to hearing, consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 and 56. All pleadings, information and documents exchanged, and the arbitrators ruling shall be treated as confidential and have no precedential value. However, if either Party seeks to confirm the arbitrators decision in court, the Parties agree that the documents necessary for such confirmation need not be filed under seal. Who will pay for costs?: Each Party will be responsible for the arbitration costs as allocated by the applicable AAA rules (www.adr.org). However, except for claims filed as part of a mass arbitration, if the arbitrator ultimately rules in your favor, you will be entitled to reimbursement by Chase for all fees you paid to the AAA. NEW SECTION: What about mass arbitration matters?: You agree that these additional requirements (Mass Arbitration Procedures) shall apply to your Claim if it is filed as part of a mass arbitration, which means twenty-five (25) or more arbitration claims involving the same or similar subject matter and/or issues of law or fact, and where representation of all claimants is the same or coordinated across the cases. You agree to these procedures even though they may delay the arbitration of your individual claim. If at any point you are unsatisfied with the speed by which your matter is proceeding, you are free to withdraw your arbitration demand and proceed in small claims court if the Claim is in that courts jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis. 1. Mass Arbitration Filing Requirements: In addition to the requirements set forth in the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, you agree that upon commencing a case with the AAA, you will provide your name, full Chase account number, mailing address, telephone number, email address, a factual description of every disputed transaction for which you seek compensation (date, amount, and transaction type) and/or event (date, location, and individuals involved), explanation of the basis of your Claim, an itemized calculation of all alleged damages, and, if represented by counsel, a signed statement authorizing us to share information regarding your account and the Claim with them. You agree and understand that failure to provide this information may result in dismissal of your Claim, though you have the right to refile once you provide the information described in the previous sentence. 2. Process Arbitrator Appointment: You and Chase agree that before an arbitrator is assigned to determine the merit of your claim, a Process Arbitrator will be appointed. The Process Arbitrator will have the authority to ensure these Mass Arbitration Procedures and the AAA rules are followed. The Parties agree that the Process Arbitrator will be selected by the process set forth in AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rule MA-7(a). In short, each Party will receive a list of proposed Process Arbitrators provided by the AAA and will meet and confer to identify a mutually-agreeable candidate. If the Parties cannot agree, they will submit their preferences to the AAA, and the AAA will select a Process Arbitrator. *end*message area 5 end of statement 6 8 000000850228997 46000000040405086201 August 14, 2024throughSeptember 13, 2024 Account Number: *start*message area 5 end of statement 3. Matters To Be Decided by a Process Arbitrator: In addition to the authority outlined in AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, the parties agree that the Process Arbitrator shall be empowered to resolve any dispute regarding whether your Claim should be dismissed because, for example, you failed to comply with the Mass Arbitration Filing Requirements, any other requirements outlined in this agreement, or any other reason. You agree that if the Process Arbitrator finds you failed to comply with any requirement, your claim will be dismissed, without prejudice to refiling once the deficiencies are remedied. The Process Arbitrator will also have the power to decide whether, based on the information submitted in the Mass Arbitration Filing Requirements, other threshold eligibility issues for your case to proceed, including but not limited to whether you had an account at Chase, experienced the transaction, fee, or event at issue, or otherwise cannot pursue the claim due to a clear legal or factual deficiency, and to dismiss your claim as appropriate. The Process Arbitrator shall have the power to determine whether or not a given dispute regarding these Mass Arbitration Filing Requirements and/or Procedures are within their jurisdiction. The Process Arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, 28 U.S.C. § 1927, or any applicable state law. 4. Mass Arbitration Procedures: Following the resolution of any disputes within the jurisdiction of the Process Arbitrator, if any, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Chase shall each select fifteen (15) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings on the merits of each claim. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, in no event shall any individual Merits Arbitrator be assigned more than three (3) cases. No AAA per case fee shall be assessed in connection with any case until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the process identified in this section. The Parties agree that each side shall have the right to have fifteen (15) cases of their choosing proceed to final hearing before the process described in this section moves forward. After the first thirty (30) cases are resolved, counsel will meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the proceedings, including whether to mediate or change the number of cases filed in each stage. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial thirty (30) proceedings and conferring in good faith, each side shall select another fifteen (15) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings. Each of these thirty (30) cases shall be assigned to a different Merits Arbitrator, though if the Parties otherwise agree, a single Merits Arbitrator may be assigned up to three (3) cases. No AAA per case fee shall be assessed in connection with the remaining cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the process identified in this section. After this second set of thirty (30) cases are resolved, counsel will again meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the proceedings, including whether to mediate or change the number of cases filed in each stage. If the Parties do not reach a global resolution after the second set of cases are resolved, on either Partys motion, the Process Arbitrator can decide to expedite the proceedings by forgoing more rounds of case selection and instead assigning Merits Arbitrators to all of the remaining cases at once. If no motion is made, this Mass Arbitration Procedure shall continue with thirty (30) cases in each set of proceedings, consistent with the parameters identified above. You and Chase agree to engage in these Mass Arbitration Procedures in good faith, which includes an agreement to pay the Parties respective case fee if your case is selected. Any dispute regarding any aspect of the specific Mass Arbitration Procedures outlined in this section shall be resolved by the Process Arbitrator. 5. Interpretation and Enforcement of Mass Arbitration Provision: Any dispute regarding the interpretation or enforcement of these mass arbitration procedures shall be decided by the Process Arbitrator or, in cases that have been released to merits proceedings, the Merits Arbitrator. Their decisions regarding the mass arbitrations process and procedures shall be considered interlocutory in nature and not subject to immediate judicial review. If any terms of these Mass Arbitration Procedures are found to be legally unenforceable for any reason, then the proceedings shall otherwise continue in arbitration in *end*message area 5 end of statement accordance with AAA's Mass Arbitration Supplementary rules. 7 8 August 14, 2024throughSeptember 13, 2024 Account Number: 000000850228997 This Page Intentionally Left Blank 8 8",-100.0,8237.33,20240913-statements-8997-.pdf

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an OverdraSftM Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking • accounts. • We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient • available balance in SyMour account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

Be prepared to give us the following information: • Your name and account number; • A description of the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and why you think it is an error or want more information; and • The amount of the suspected error.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an OverdraSftM Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking • accounts. • We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient • available balance in SyMour account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

For personal accounts only: We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. Be prepared to give us the following information: • Your name and account number; • A description of the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and why you think it is an error or want more information; and • The amount of the suspected error.

Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly processing. We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in the Deposit Account Agreement. We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways: 1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account. 2. We offer Overdraft Protection through a link to a Chase savings account, which may be less expensive than our Standard Overdraft Practice. You can contSaMct us to learn more. 3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage. • What is the Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with my account? W• e do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions: • Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships) • What is Chase Debit Card Coverage? If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we may authorize and pay overdrafts for everyday debit card transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice. • What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft? If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee per transaction during our nightly processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 3 fees per business day, up to $102). W• e wont charge you an OverdraSftM Fee in the following circumstances: With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day OR if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking • accounts. • We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less. We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient • available balance in SyMour account. SM For Chase Sapphire Checking and Chase Private Client Checking accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged. • What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions? If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. Yo®u can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 *end*message area 5 end of statement (or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch.

For personal accounts only: We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. Be prepared to give us the following information: • Your name and account number; • A description of the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and why you think it is an error or want more information; and • The amount of the suspected error.
